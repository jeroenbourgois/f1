Circuit:
- 8 ohm speaker on digital pin 2
- 5 LEDs connected to digital pins 9 -> 13,
  each LED grounded with a 220Î© resistor
- 'OK' pushbutton on analog pin A3 (used as digital pin) and +5V
- 'CANCEL' pushbutton on analog pin A4 (used as digital pin) and +5V
- two reed switches to measure passing cars, analog pins A1 and A2 and +5v
- LCD:
   - data pins D4 -> D7 wired to digital pins 7 -> 4
   - E pin wired to digital pin 8
   - RS pin wired to digital pin 3
   - VCC+ and
   - a potentionmeter with it's middle leg connected to the LCD 4

A detailed Fritzing sketch is available in the repository.

On the LCD we have the following screens:

START -> [Y] -> COUNTDOWN -> RACE --> [Y] -> QUIT? -> [Y] -> START
                                  |                -> [N] -> RACE
                                  --> [N] -> n/a
